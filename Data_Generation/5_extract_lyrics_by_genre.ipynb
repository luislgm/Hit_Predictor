Se han escogido estos dos géneros, ya que estos están dentro de los 10 géneros más exitosos dentro de los *hits* como se ha podido ver en el cuaderno 1_hit_analysis. El género *pop* es un género que siempre ha sido muy bien recibido por las listas de éxitos, y el *urban* está ganando cada vez más fuerza en las listas. Así se hará la extracción de las canciones pertenecientes a estos 2 géneros."
