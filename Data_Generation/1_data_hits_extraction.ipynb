    "# Data Hits Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "En este cuaderno se explicará el proceso llevado a cabo para la extracción de los *hits* que aparecen en la lista de *billboard hot-100*, con todas sus características.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para la extracción de se ha desarrollado un objeto (Music_Data), con varias funciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "El objeto ofrece un total de 5 funciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get_Billboard_Data -> Dado un rango de fechas se extraen todos los *hits Hot-100* de *billboard* en ese rango y se añaden diferentes características de cada una de las canciones obtenidas a través de la API de *spotify (spotipy)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Get_Billboard_Data_Lyrics -> Esta función es igual a la anterior, pero añade además, la letra de cada una de las canciones. Se crearon 2 funciones, ya que en un principio se usaba esta función. Pero el proceso es bastante lento en comparación con el anterior, debido al funcionamiento de la API de extracción de canciones (Lyric Genius). Como existen muchas duplicidades en la extracción, se pensó que sería mejor hacer una extracción sin letras de canciones y una vez eliminados todos los duplicados, añadir las letras sobre las canciones de interés, ahorrando mucho tiempo en el proceso.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get_User_Playlist_Data -> Función que permite obtener, para un usuario de *Spotify* dado, todas las canciones de todas sus playlists públicas, con las características de las mismas.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Get_User_Playlist_Data_Lyrics -> Función igual a la anterior, que añade a cada una de las canciones, la letra de la misma. Por lo mismo que comentado en la función 2, existen 2 funciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Get_Lyrics -> Función que dado un dataframe, de los generados con Get_Billboard_Data o Get_User_Playlist_Data, añade la letra de las canciones, esta función se aplicará cuando se filtre por las canciones de interés, y por tanto será mucho más rápido el proceso, de extracción.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para la generación de los *hits* solo son necesarias las funciones Get_Billboard_Data y/o Get_Billboard_Data_Lyrics, las demás funciones serán usadas en los siguientes cuadernos, ya sea para descargar canciones aleatorias o para extraer las letras de las canciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "La extracción se ha ido realizando por año desde 1958 (Desde que se existen registros de *Hot-100*) hasta agosto de 2020. Se ha realizado una extracción por año para evitar errores debidos a la conexión, ya que si el rango de fechas es demasiado grande, el tiempo de duración de extracción será más alto y puede ocurrir problemas por alguna caida de conexión y demas, se hace esto para asegurar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Como se han realizado extracciones desde 1958 hasta 2020, se han realizado un total de 62 extracciones.\n",
    "Algunas se realizaron con Get_Billboard_Data_Lyrics (las primeras) y otras con Get_Billboard_Data, para agilizar el proceso. \n",
    "\n",
    "En este notebook se mostrarán ejemplos de extracción llevados a cabo. No se mostrarán todas las extracciones, ya que el proceso es exactamente el mismo para cada uno de los años.\n",
